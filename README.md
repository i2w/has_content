has_content [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/i2w/has_content.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/i2w/has_content)
======

Add a content relation to any active_record, which acts like a text field, but is actually a separate object.

This means it's very easy to add/remove fields, but also the contents can be objects in their own right (useful for editing CMS stuff etc)
